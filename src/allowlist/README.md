# Allowlist

## Design

### Components

`allowlist` combines a Redis in-memory database with an asynchronous REST API.
The server, implemented in Rust, is modeled off a [basic `axum` example] and
adapts features from an [`axum` with Redis example], in particular a
[custom extractor] for a database connection, which is extended in `allowlist`
via a [nested extractor].

### Containerization

To simplify container layout, `allowlist` is compiled to a static binary using
the `musl` C library and a multi-stage Docker build. Notably, for Rust
applications without any non-Rust dependencies, this approach enables the
compilation of a standalone executable such that the resulting Docker image is
only as large as the target Rust binary itself. For relevant blog posts on this
topic, see [here][how to create small docker images for rust],
[here][how to package rust applications into minimal docker containers],
[here][use multi-stage docker builds for statically-linked rust binaries], and
[here][docker "from scratch" for rust applications]. For forum discussions, see
[here][looking for the perfect dockerfile for rust],
[here][how to generate statically linked executables?], and
[here][rust linker fails when using target-feature=+crt-static on nightly]. For
relevant Rust documentation see [here][static and dynamic c runtimes] and
[here][`target-feature`].

The `allowlist` binary leverages the [`mimalloc` crate] as a drop-in
[global allocator] solution, which is required to prevent asynchronous
performance regression when statically compiling against `musl`, as detailed
[here][supercharging your rust static executables with mimalloc],
[here][testing alternative c memory allocators pt 2: the musl mystery], and
[here][static linking for rust without glibc - scratch image]. Notably, this
approach eliminates the requirement of a Docker build image with a
manually-patched allocator, as proposed [here][`rust-alpine-mimalloc`],
[here][`mimalloc`], and [here][`alpine-mimalloc`].

Static containerization is performed via the [`muslrust`] image due to its
extensive instructive documentation (in particular its examples and
[`mimalloc` commentary]), though notably there are several other comparable
solutions including [`rust-musl-builder`], which contains a useful index of
associated projects.  Cross-compilation to the `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
target architecture is *not* performed in the `allowlist` Dockerfile, so as to
enable local builds with the Docker compose environment. For more on
cross-compilation, see [here][building x86 rust containers from mac silicon],
[here][cross-compiling static rust binaries in docker for raspberry pi], and
[here][`rust-static-builder`].

Per [`muslrust`] best practice recommendations, [`cargo-chef`] is used for image
layer caching, and the final executable is stored in a [`chainguard/static`]
base image (rather than `scratch`) as additionally recommended
[here][`kube.rs` best practices]. This approach yields a final Docker image that
is only 3.1 MB.

## Running a local deployment

From repository root:

```sh
docker compose --file src/allowlist/compose.yaml up
```

Or in detached mode:

```sh
docker compose --file src/allowlist/compose.yaml up --detach
```

To stop from detached mode:

```sh
docker compose --file src/allowlist/compose.yaml down
```

## Check if address is allowed

```sh
REQUESTED_ADDRESS=0x123
curl localhost:3000/$REQUESTED_ADDRESS | jq
```

## Add address to allowlist

```sh
REQUESTED_ADDRESS=0x123
curl localhost:3000/$REQUESTED_ADDRESS -X POST | jq
```
